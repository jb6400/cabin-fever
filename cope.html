        <p>The coping mechanism that works best for you will have a lot to do with your personal situation. Finding meaningful ways to engage your brain and occupy your time can help alleviate the distress and irritability that cabin fever brings.</p>

          <span class="popuptextC" id="myPopup1">
          <p>Invest in some houseplants. Houseplants can help a space feel more lively and connected to the outside world.</p>
          <p>Get some ambient noise going.</p>
          </span>
        </div>

          <p>Try something new</p>
          <span class="popuptextC" id="myPopup3">
            <p>Learn a new skill: Sign up for an online art class, learn to speak Mandarin, try baking French macarons or teach yourself a chord on the guitar you bought seven years ago and never learned to play.</p>
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="popup" onclick='listener("myPopup4")'>

            <p>In the age of social distancing, use virtual connections to fill the gap:</p>
            <li>Schedule a happy hour: Plan a regular time to video chat with your friends or family members</li>

            <li>Write letters: Texts are practically essential during self-isolation, but it’s fun to channel your inner Victorian.</li>

            <li>Open up: When talking with your loved ones ­­­­(in person or virtually),­ you don’t have to put on a brave face. “Being honest about your worries, fears and future dreams can bring you closer and make your relationship stronger,” Dr. Bea says.</li>

            <li>Redecorate and/or rearrange your space</li>
