        <p>Cabin fever is a series of negative emotions and distressing sensations people may face if theyâ€™re isolated or feeling cut off from the world.</p>

        <p>These feelings of loneliness are more likely in times of social distancing, self-quarantining during a pandemic, or sheltering in place.</p>

        <p> The origin of the term dates back to the early 1900s in North America, when it may have referred to someone who was isolated in a remote area, or cabin, especially during the winter when it was necessary to stay indoors for days at a time.

        <p>The concept of cabin fever was used as a theme in Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1866 novel Crime and Punishment, Chaplin's 1925 film The Gold Rush, Stefan Zweig's 1948 novella The Royal Game, the 1980 horror film The Shining, The Simpsons episode "Mountain of Madness", and so on </p>
